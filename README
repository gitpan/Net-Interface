README for Net::Interface version 1.xx

Net::Interface is a module that allows access to the host
network interfaces in a manner similar to ifconfig(8).
Version 1.00 is a complete re-write and includes support
for IPV6 as well as the traditional IPV4.

Creating and deleting interfaces is not yet supported 
although the documentation says otherwise. Give it some 
time.

Net::Interface 1.0x works on more platforms and supports 
all the operations of the previous version with the addition
of ipV6 support as well as numerous new methods and functions.

Hackers welcome, see Net::Interface::Developer.

There are revisions to the API, see the section titled:

	WARNING - API CHANGES

In most instances this will not make a difference since previous
versions of Net::Interface had no support for multiple addresses 
on the same interface and no support for a variety of platforms 
where the difference would be noticed.

NOT YET SUPPORTED:

	$if->delete
	$if->new(%iface_spec)	(create or update)
	$if->hwaddr($new_mac)	(change MAC addr)

If something except the three items above does not work on your
platform, please let me know. I have limited availability OS's 
with which to develop and a development account on a foreign host 
with a different OS would be very useful.

UN-TESTED CODE

Code to retrieve the MAC address using:

    #ifdef HAVE_NIT_IF_H	(sun OS, not solaris)
	or
    #ifdef HAVE_NETIO_H		(win32, not yet supported)
	or
    "style 1" DLPI		(...ooold solaris)

is implemented but untested. If you have a platform to test this,
your assistance would be appreciated.
